VPC Design & Configuration: Created and configured a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with custom IP ranges, ensuring a structured and secure network environment.  

Subnet Setup: Designed and deployed public and private subnets within the VPC to enable efficient network segmentation.  

Route Table Configuration: Created and associated route tables with the respective subnets to manage network traffic effectively.  

Network Security Implementation: Configured network access control lists (ACLs) to regulate inbound and outbound traffic for enhanced security.  

Security Group Setup: Defined and applied security groups for EC2 instances, restricting access based on necessary ports and protocols. 

EC2 Instance Deployment: Launched and configured EC2 instances in both public and private subnets, ensuring proper role-based access control.  

IAM Role Assignment: Created and assigned IAM roles with specific permissions to EC2 instances for secure access to AWS resources.  

Internet Access Configuration: Set up an internet gateway to provide internet access for instances in the public subnet.  

Private Subnet Connectivity: Configured a NAT gateway or NAT instance to enable outbound internet access for instances in the private subnet.  

SSH Key Management:Generated and securely stored an SSH key pair, allowing secure SSH access only with the generated key.  

Access Control & IAM Policies: Implemented IAM policies and roles to manage and restrict access to AWS resources efficiently.  

Network Connectivity Testing:Verified SSH access to EC2 instances, ensuring secure authentication and connection.  

Inter-Subnet Communication: Tested network connectivity between instances located in different subnets to validate communication. 

Security Validation: Checked and validated security group rules and network ACL configurations to ensure proper security enforcement.  

Scalability & Performance Optimization: Designed the architecture to support scalability while optimizing performance and network efficiency. 

Best Practices & Compliance: Followed AWS security best practices and compliance guidelines to ensure a robust cloud infrastructure. 

Hands-on AWS Experience: Gained practical exposure to AWS networking, security, and infrastructure management, strengthening cloud architecture expertise.
